Good news for my native land: &nbsp;After a subpar performance at the Winter Olympics (again), Finland has come first in The World Happiness Report for 2018! This news has all of Finland in a frenzy, not unlike when Lordi, a hard rock band dressed up as monsters, won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006. It’s given the Finns strength to patiently keep waiting for the end of May, when spring finally begins in the over 60&deg; latitudes.

70 % of the country I was born in is covered in trees. It is also littered with lakes (about 56 000 or 188 000, depending on your criteria). It is a great place for outdoors activities, for raising a family and for a peaceful life. It’s not perfect, but in the grand scheme of things, it’s pretty darn good. I could go on and on about the reasons why Finland is the happiest place in the world: it has high quality free basic education, relatively little inequality and very comprehensive social security.

Instead, I’d like to dedicate the remaining paragraphs to justifying why, despite my deep affection for the country that invented Angry Birds, the bubble chair and the heart rate monitor, I haven’t lived in the happiest place on the planet for most of my adult life. What is wrong with me? Why on earth don’t I live in Finland?

There are 4 reasons.

Reason number 1: My bad habit. Let me explain: I didn’t spend all my childhood and youth in Finland. My parents’ work took me briefly to the UK and then to South Asia for a good number of years. Once you have that international experience, it’s natural to keep moving. It’s very hard to stop. You get used to being a foreigner. A kind of a bad habit if you will. Once you’ve lived in the Himalayas, it’s hard to get used to a Finnish bog again.

Reason number 2: Low self-esteem. The (stereo)typical Finn is painfully modest. I used to be self-deprecating to the point of it not being funny anymore. It’s mostly worn off now, but I still feel like I don’t deserve to live in such a wonderful country as Finland.

Reason number 3: Self-preservation. I have terrible navigation skills. I can’t read a map to save my life and if the lovely Google Maps GPS lady were a real person she would have strangled me by now. Can you imagine what life would be like for someone like me in a place where there are 22 billion trees (yes, I googled it) and only 5.5 million people? If I had spent all my formative years in Finland, I probably would have learnt orienteering, which is a very popular sport in Finland. So most Finns are just fine in the forest. I missed the boat and, well, it’s too late now.

Reason number 4: Children. What? Didn’t I just say that it’s a great place to raise a family? And why wouldn’t I want to raise my children in the country that takes pride in its excellent education system? Blame the weather. Even with climate change, winters are still cold in Finland. There’s snow, ice and below zero temperatures (and by below zero I mean way below zero). What does that mean for a mother of young children? Dressing your kids in a ski suit from October to April. Do you have any idea how hard those things are to put on? And then how hot and bothered your child gets while they wait for their sibling to get dressed? And just as you’re about to leave, nature calls and you have to take their ski suit off AND put it on again? Thanks but no thanks.

While I don’t want to discredit the report – after all, &nbsp;I wouldn’t want to deprive Finland of its chance to bathe in glory - let’s take these reports with a pinch of salt. I would never say never to living in Finland, but for the time being I remain a happy foreigner in Spain. I feel like I’m worthy of its quaint architecture and good wine. If I get lost, someone is bound to help me because there is always someone around – always. And quite frankly I feel happy knowing that my children can play in the plaza all year round while I have my coffee and soak in the sun.
